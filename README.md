# Smart Irrigation

Welcome to the Smart Irrigation project! This repository contains the backend API that utilizes machine learning and analysis algorithms, along with other APIs, to create an intelligent irrigation system.

## Introduction

Smart Irrigation aims to optimize water usage in agricultural practices by leveraging data-driven insights and automation. The backend API serves as the core component, enabling efficient management of irrigation processes based on real-time environmental factors and predictive modeling.

## Features

- **Machine Learning:** The backend API incorporates machine learning algorithms to analyze various data inputs such as, soil moisture levels, temprature and humidity and rain data. This analysis allows for accurate predictions and smart decision-making regarding irrigation scheduling.

- **Data Analysis:** With advanced data analysis techniques, the API interprets incoming data streams and provides valuable insights soil conditions, and irrigation patterns. These insights help farmers make informed decisions to enhance productivity and conserve water resources.
